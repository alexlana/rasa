title: Slot Validation Actions
abstract: A slot validation action is a special type of custom action, designed to handle custom extraction and/or validation of slot values. This can be used to validate slots with predefined mappings or extract slots with custom mappings.
---

Rasa SDK provides three base classes that you can inherit from in order to implement custom slot extraction and
validation logic:

## `Action` class

You can use this class to create a regular [custom action](./custom-actions.mdx). The base class will not prevent you
from returning arbitrary events, however a slot validation action should only return `SlotSet` and `BotUttered` events.
Any other event type will be filtered out by the default action [`action_extract_slots`](./default-actions.mdx#action_extract_slots).
The name of the custom action must be specified in the `action` key of the relevant
[custom slot mapping](./domain.mdx#custom-slot-mappings) in the domain.
Note that the action name must be listed in the domain `actions` section too.

## `ValidationAction` class

You can extend the `ValidationAction` class in the Rasa SDK to define custom extraction and / or validation of slots that
can be set or updated outside of a form context.

:::note
`ValidationAction` is intended for extracting slots **outside** the context of a form.
It will ignore extraction and validation methods for any slots that have a form specified under the slot mapping's `conditions`.
It will not run these methods when the specified form is active nor when no form is active.
Please extend the [`FormValidationAction`](./slot-validation-actions.mdx#formvalidationaction-class) class for applying
custom slot mappings only within the context of a form.
:::

Note that you do not need to implement the `name` method in the custom action extending `ValidationAction`, since this
is already provided: `action_validate_slot_mappings`. However this name must be added to the domain `actions` list.
If you override the `name` method, the custom validation action will not run because the original name is hardcoded
in the call that the default action `action_extract_slots` makes to the action server.

With this option, you do not need to specify the `action` key in the [custom slot mapping](./domain.mdx#custom-slot-mappings),
since the default action [`action_extract_slots`](./default-actions.mdx#action_extract_slots) runs `action_validate_slot_mappings`
automatically if present in the `actions` section of the domain.

### Validation of Slots with Predefined Mappings

To validate slots with a predefined mapping, you must write functions named `validate_<slot_name>`.

In the following example, the value for slot `location` is capitalized only if the extracted value is of type string:

```python
from typing import Text, Any, Dict

from rasa_sdk import Tracker, ValidationAction
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.types import DomainDict


class ValidatePredefinedSlots(ValidationAction):
    def validate_location(
        self,
        slot_value: Any,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: DomainDict,
    ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
        """Validate location value."""
        if isinstance(slot_value, str):
            # validation succeeded, capitalize the value of the "location" slot
            return {"location": slot_value.capitalize()}
        else:
            # validation failed, set this slot to None
            return {"location": None}
```

### Extraction of Custom Slot Mappings

In order to define custom extraction code, you must write an `extract_<slot_name>` method for every slot with a
custom slot mapping.

The following example shows the implementation of a custom action that extracts the slot `count_of_insults` to keep
track of the user's attitude.

```python
from typing import Dict, Text, Any

from rasa_sdk import Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.forms import ValidationAction


class ValidateCustomSlotMappings(ValidationAction):
    async def extract_count_of_insults(
        self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict
    ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
        intent_of_last_user_message = tracker.get_intent_of_latest_message()
        current_count_of_insults = tracker.get_slot("count_of_insults")
        if intent_of_last_user_message == "insult":
           current_count_of_insults += 1

        return {"count_of_insults": current_count_of_insults}
```

## `FormValidationAction` class

A `FormValidationAction` custom action will only run if the form it specifies in its name is activated.
If certain custom slot mappings should only be extracted and / or validated within the context of a form,
the custom action should inherit from `FormValidationAction` rather than from `ValidationAction`.
Since `FormValidationAction` runs on every user turn only as long as the form is active, it is not required to use
mapping conditions for custom slot mappings defined in a custom action extending `FormValidationAction`.
